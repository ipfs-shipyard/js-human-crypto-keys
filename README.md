Generate and import human-friendly cryptographic keys using mnemonics, QR codes and other methods.


## Installation

```sh
$ npm install human-crypto-keys
```

This library is written in modern JavaScript and is published in both CommonJS and ES module transpiled variants. If you target older browsers please make sure to transpile accordingly.


## Usage

```js
import { generateKeyPair, getKeyPairFromMnemonic, getKeyPairFromSeed } from 'human-crypto-keys';

const keyPair = await generateKeyPair('rsa');
// => Generates a key pair with rsa encryption and provides information for recovery.

const keyPairFromMnemonic = await getKeyPairFromMnemonic(keyPair.mnemonic, keyPair.algorithm);
// => Generates the same key pair based on the mnemonic.

const keyPairFromSeed = await getKeyPairFromSeed(keyPair.seed, keyPair.algorithm);
// => Generates the same key pair based on the seed.

```

> ⚠️ human-crypto-keys depends on cryptographic modules that can increase the bundle size of your projects significantly. You might want to break big bundles in smaller pieces with the help of [dynamic imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#Dynamic_Imports).

## API

The mnemonic provided as one of the recovery methods for a key pair.

    privateKey, // The generated private key composed in a specific format.
    publicKey,  // The generated public key composed in a specific format. 
}
```

#### seed

Type: `String`

The seed provided as one of the recovery methods for a key pair.

#### algorithm

Type: `Object` or `String`

The algorithm identifier and the respective parameters to generate a key pair. Please read the [algorithms](#algorithms) section for more information.

#### options

Type: `Object`

Options to be used while composing keys. Please read the [options](#options) section for more information.

### Common Parameters

#### algorithm
 
Type: `Object` or `String`

The algorithm identifier and the respective parameters to generate a key pair.

It can be specified as an `Object` or a `String`. Using an `Object` will provide freedom to override default algorithm parameters in relation to its type. On the other hand, a `String` presents a useful and quick approach if the default parameters are suitable.

The default parameters are different for each algorithm type. Currently only 2 types are supported:

<details><summary><strong>RSA</strong></summary>

Default Parameters:
```js
{
	modulusLength: 2048		    // Number
	publicExponent: 65537		// Number
	method: 'PRIMEINC'		    // String
}
```

You can override only the parameters that you need, all the other ones remain with default values. 

> ⚠️ Please make sure that values follow the same type as default ones. Also, parameters that are not available as default are not supported.

Example `Object`:
```js
const algorithm = {
    id: 'rsa',
    modulusLength: 4096,
}
```

Example `String`:
```js
const algorithm = 'rsa';
```

In the examples above we are using an alias for RSA encryption. Although this is possible, the full list of supported RSA key algorithms can be found in the [RSA Keys Section](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/js-crypto-key-composer/tree/initial-impl#key-algorithms) of [crypto-key-composer](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/js-crypto-key-composer) package.

##### Generation

The following steps detail how the generation of a RSA key pair is being done:
1. Create a Pseudorandom Number Generator, `prng` for short, with [HMAC-DRBG](https://github.com/indutny/hmac-drbg) using a `seed` as its generation entropy. This seed is directly provided when using `getKeyFromSeed` or inferred from a mnemonic passed in `getKeyFromMnemonic`. If neither the seed nor the mnemonic are available they can both be generated, as done in `generateKeyPair`. The generation of a mnemonic and its derived seed are done with [bip39](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip39), a well established method used in bitcoin wallets.
2. Generate a key pair, using [Node Forge RSA](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge#rsa) generation method, with all necessary algorithm parameters and the `prng` created previously.
3. Compose both keys with the defined formats.

<details><summary><strong>ED25519</strong></summary>

This algorithm doesn't have any default parameters since it just relies on 32 bytes randomly generated.

Example `Object`:
```js
const algorithm = { id: 'ed25519' };
```

Example `String`:
```js
const algorithm = 'ed25519';
```

##### Generation

The following steps detail how the generation of a ED25519 key pair is being done:
1. Generate a key pair, using [Node Forge ED25519](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge#ed25519) generation method, with a 32 bytes `seed`. This seed is directly provided when using `getKeyFromSeed` or inferred from a mnemonic passed in `getKeyFromMnemonic`. If neither the seed nor the mnemonic are available they can both be generated, as done in `generateKeyPair`. The generation of a mnemonic and its derived seed are done with [bip39](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip39), a well established method used in bitcoin wallets.
2. Compose both keys with the defined formats.

#### options

Type: `Object`

The current options allow you to decide both private and public key formats, the private key encryption and the password to use to encrypt the key.

Available options:

<details><summary><strong>privateKeyFormat</strong></summary>

Type: `String`

Default: `pkcs8-pem`

The format in which the private key will be composed.

Keys can be composed in different formats and vary by algorithm. All formats available are described in the [Formats Section](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/js-crypto-key-composer/tree/initial-impl#formats) of [crypto-key-composer](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/js-crypto-key-composer) package.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>publicKeyFormat</strong></summary>

Type: `String`

Default: `spki-pem`

The format in which the public key will be composed.

Keys can be composed in different formats and vary by algorithm. All formats available are described in the [Formats Section](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/js-crypto-key-composer/tree/initial-impl#formats) of [crypto-key-composer](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/js-crypto-key-composer) package.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>encryptionAlgorithm</strong></summary>

Type: `Object`

The encryption algorithm that will be used to encrypt the private key.
